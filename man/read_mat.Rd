\title{Read 'Matlab' files}
\usage{
read_mat(file, ram = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{path to a 'Matlab' file}

\item{ram}{whether to load data into memory. Only available when
the file is in 'HDF5' format. Default is false and will load arrays,
if set to true, then lazy-load data. This is useful when array is very large.}
}
\value{
A list of All the data stored in the file
}
\description{
A compatible reader that can read both 'Matlab'
files prior and after version 6.0
}
\details{
\code{\link[R.matlab]{readMat}} can only read 'Matlab' files
prior to version 6. After version 6, 'Matlab' uses 'HDF5' format
to store its data, and \code{read_mat} can handle both cases.

The performance of \code{read_mat} can be limited when
the file is too big or has many datasets as it reads all the
data contained in 'Matlab' file into memory.

\examples{

# Matlab .mat <= v7.3
x <- matrix(1:16, 4)
f <- tempfile()
R.matlab::writeMat(con = f, x = x)

read_mat(f)

# Matlab .mat >= v7.3, using hdf5
# Make sure you have installed rhdf5 from bioConductor
if( dipsaus::package_installed('rhdf5') ){

f <- tempfile()
save_h5(x, file = f, name = 'x')

read_mat(f)

# For v7.3, you don't have to load all data into RAM
dat <- read_mat(f, ram = FALSE)
dat

dat$x[]
