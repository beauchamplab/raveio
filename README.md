'RAVE' is a R project that aims at providing interactive analysis and visualization of intracranial Electroencephalography. Developed by `Beauchamp's Lab`, supported by NIH `1R24MH117529`

This package is part of `rave` family that provides readers from multiple file formats, including:
* `EDF(+)`, `BrainVision`, `BIDS-iEEG`, `Matlab` files commonly used by neuroscientists
* `HDF5`, common file format used by 'Matlab', 'Python', 'C++', and 'R'
* `FST`, a file format that supports GB-level read/write speed
